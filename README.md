[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/02f92353-d1de-42c0-b6fc-a29d1d40b183/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hackwestx/deploys)

ðŸŽµ We're back and we're better âœ¨
Here you can find the code behind [HackWesTX](https://www.HackwesTX.tech), Texas Tech University's second student-run hackathon!

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## The Point

The reason why there was an overhaul at all is only because the last site had been built on an old version of React.
Now that we're back up to date (although a little plain), we can add whatever we want.

### Functional Goals

- [x] - Recreate all elements from the original site
- [-] - Make it prettier
  - [ ] - Something to spice up the [Jumbotron](components/individual/Jumbotron.tsx)
  - [x] - Fill up some of the whitespace, whether its juicy css curves or interactive cacti, or anything else
- [ ] - Auth and QR code support (I'll get on that ~ @Guysnacho)
- [-] - Responsive navbar/sandwich menu for other pages
  - [ ] - 1. Distribute content across other pages
  - [x] - 2. Add [Navbar](components/Navbar.tsx) and simple routing
  - [x] - 3. Add routing for [authed pages](pages/hackers.tsx) (pages you can only access while logged in)

### Learning Goals

There isn't really a point in doing this if we're not trying something spicy so let's learn the following (at least)

1. [Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs)
2. Building reusable components with [React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn6-PIqc4UM)
3. Complex firebase interactions so we can do cool stuff that hackers will use before/during/and after the hackathon

   - [Chat app tutorial using react-firebase-hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88&t=395s)
   - [react-firebase-hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks) library

Alright lets go ~
